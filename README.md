## About

Built a weather dashboard that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS. Uses the [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) to retrieve weather data for cities.

## Usage

Search for a city in the top left search bar. The current weather and future forecast will display on the right. Your search will also be saved in a search history list on the left.
